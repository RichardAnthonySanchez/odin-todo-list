# Todos List (Productify)

## What is Todos List?
Todos List is a task management application designed to help users organize and prioritize their daily tasks. Users can group tasks into projects, assign priorities, and track their progress by marking tasks as completed. The intuitive interface makes it easy to manage even the most complex task lists.

## Why Does Todos List Exist?
Todos List was created as a practical exercise in applying clean architecture principles, as outlined by Uncle Bob in his book *Clean Architecture*. The project serves as a demonstration of how to build maintainable, scalable software with a clear separation of concerns.
